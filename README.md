# smallurl

This is a small and really cool URL shortener that I made using Vue 3 and Deta Base!

This project is still a work in progress, like all my other projects.

- [X] URL redirecting works
- [ ] The user should get alerts/popus on the shortened URL 
- [ ] View stats of individual slugs
 
### Stuff I Used

- Vue 3 (wanted to use the Composition API so badly but I decided to stick with the Options API)
- [Deta Base ](https://www.deta.sh/)
- Serverless functions, courtesy of [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Darkmode.js](https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/), because I was too lazy to implement darkmode myself using custom styles
